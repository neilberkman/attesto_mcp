defmodule Mix.Tasks.AttestoMcp.Install do
  @shortdoc "Scaffolds an MCP protected resource into a Phoenix application"
  @moduledoc """
  #{@shortdoc}

  Wires the building blocks an MCP server needs to act as an OAuth 2.0
  protected resource into a host Phoenix application:

    * The OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata endpoint (RFC 9728 Section 3),
      mounted from the per-resource well-known path (RFC 9728 Section 3.1) with
      the same route form emitted by
      `AttestoMCP.Router.attesto_mcp_protected_resource_metadata/2`.
    * A Phoenix pipeline that enforces bearer-token authentication and the
      required OAuth scopes (RFC 6750 Bearer Token Usage, RFC 6749 Section 3.3
      scope semantics) via `AttestoMCP.Plug.ProtectResource`.

  This task is idempotent: re-running it will not duplicate the pipeline or the
  scopes that a previous run already added. Igniter matches the pipeline by name
  and the scope by its exact contents, so a second run is a no-op.

  ## Example

  ```sh
  #{example}
  ```

  ## Options

  * `--resource-path` - the path component of the protected resource being
    served, for example `/mcp` (RFC 9728 Section 3.1). The metadata endpoint is
    mounted at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource<resource-path>` and the
    protecting pipeline is piped through the matching scope. Defaults to `/mcp`.
  * `--scopes` - a comma-separated list of OAuth scope strings the bearer token
    must carry to access the protected resource (RFC 6749 Section 3.3). Defaults
    to `mcp:use`.
  * `--router` - the Phoenix router module to wire the routes into. Defaults to
    the application's discovered router.
